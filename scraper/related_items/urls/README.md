## Plot URLs
*Scraped from http://shepherd.caltech.edu/detn_db/html/plots.html*

These files list the URL of each plot on the original database. There is a file for each category to keep track of the categories, and everything is in the order that they appear on the index. The first line in each file is the name of the category.
