# DB Module

This Django app is responsible for categorizing the database on the site. In other words, this app provides the views that give a simple index that we can browse manually, and also where we can locate specific database items.

When we use the `search` app, we are given a list of links that take use to routes in the `db` app.

## Example Routes
detdb.com/db/detonations/cell-size/width/ja5d
detdb.com/db/plots/cell-size/some-plot-title
